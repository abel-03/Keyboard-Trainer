The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Life is like a box of chocolates
A penny for your thoughts
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Actions speak louder than words
A watched pot never boils
You can't have your cake and eat it too
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Every cloud has a silver lining
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Practice makes perfect
Two wrongs don't make a right
All that glitters is not gold
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
Better late than never
The early bird catches the worm
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Haste makes waste
There's no smoke without fire
Out of sight, out of mind
Actions speak louder than words
Every cloud has a silver lining
Where there's smoke, there's fire
A picture is worth a thousand words
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs
All's fair in love and war
Birds of a feather flock together
You can't have your cake and eat it
Like father, like son
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
You can't judge a book by its cover
The grass is always greener on the other side
Every dog has its day
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
A rolling stone gathers no moss
A stitch in time saves nine
A penny for your thoughts
A leopard can't change its spots
As you sow, so shall you reap
Beggars can't be choosers
The pen is mightier than the sword
Better late than never
Two heads are better than one
The early bird catches the worm
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
The more, the merrier
You can't win them all
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
What goes around comes around
Actions speak louder than words
A friend in need is a friend indeed
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Necessity is the mother of invention
A watched pot never boils
Better safe than sorry
You can't have your cake and eat it too
A fool and his money are soon parted
All that glitters is not gold
Haste makes waste
When in doubt, do without
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
Every cloud has a silver lining
All's well that ends well
The customer is always right
The early bird catches the worm
A penny for your thoughts
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill
The best things in life are free
A penny saved is a penny earned
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
A picture is worth a thousand words
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
A rolling stone gathers no moss
Birds of a feather flock together
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
You can't have your cake and eat it too
